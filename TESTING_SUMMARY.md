## 🔧 Manual Testing Instructions

Since the application is running at http://localhost:8080, perform these manual tests:

### 1. Basic Hover Testing
1. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
2. Switch between grid and list views
3. Hover over multiple bookmark cards
4. Look for smooth animations without choppiness
5. Verify no content "reloading" or flickering

### 2. Performance Monitoring
1. Look for the ⚡ lightning bolt icon in the header (development mode)
2. Click the ⚡ icon to enable performance monitoring
3. Observe real-time metrics below the header
4. Click "Test Performance" to run the built-in test suite
5. Verify all 5 performance tests pass

### 3. Browser DevTools Testing
1. Open Chrome DevTools → Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Hover over multiple bookmark cards
4. Stop recording and analyze:
   - Look for consistent green bars (60fps)
   - Check for minimal layout thrashing
   - Verify GPU layer usage in Layers tab

### 4. Responsive Testing
1. Test on different viewport sizes
2. Try mobile device emulation
3. Test zoom in/out behavior
4. Check reduced motion setting compliance
