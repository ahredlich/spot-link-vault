contain: layout style paint;
content-visibility: auto;
isolation: isolate;
```

### Hover Effect Optimization
```css
.glass-card:hover:not([role="dialog"]):not(.no-hover-transform) {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-glass-hover);
  transform: translateY(-2px) translateZ(0);
  transition: var(--transition-glass-hover);
  will-change: transform;
}
```

### Zoom Performance Integration
```css
.glass-card-enhanced.no-hover-transform:hover {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-glass-lg);
  transform: translateZ(0);
  transition: var(--transition-shadow);
}
```
